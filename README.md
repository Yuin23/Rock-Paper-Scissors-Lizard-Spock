# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock #

#### Task: ####
	This project is to implement the game Rock-paper-scissors, with two addtional weapon, lizard and Spock. The code is written in javascript. 


- Background of the game:

	Rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock is an expansion of the classic selection method game rock-paper-scissors. It operates on the same basic principle, but includes two additional weapons: the lizard (formed by the hand as a sock-puppet-like mouth) and Spock(formed by the Star Trek Vulcan salute). This reduces the chances of a round ending in a tie. The game was invented by Sam Kass with Karen Bryla, as "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".The game was mentioned in four episodes of The Big Bang Theory.
